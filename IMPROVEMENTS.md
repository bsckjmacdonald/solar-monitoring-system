# Solar Monitor System Improvements

This document describes the improvements made to reduce SD card wear and enhance security.

## üîß SD Card Wear Fix (Critical)

### Problem
The original system rewrote the entire JSON file every 5 seconds (720 times per hour), causing excessive SD card wear that could lead to premature failure.

### Solution
Implemented append-only logging using JSONL (JSON Lines) format:
- Each sensor reading is appended as a single line instead of rewriting the entire file
- Reduces write operations from 720 full file rewrites to 720 single line appends per hour
- Significantly extends SD card lifespan

### Changes Made
- Modified `sensor_monitor.py` to use append-only logging
- Updated `web_app.py` to read both JSON and JSONL formats (backward compatibility)
- Changed file extension from `.json` to `.jsonl` for new files
- Added migration script to convert existing data

### Migration
Run the migration script to convert existing data:
```bash
python3 migrate_data_format.py
```

## üîí Security Enhancements

### Problems Fixed
1. **Debug mode enabled in production** - Exposes sensitive information
2. **No authentication** - Web interface accessible to anyone on network
3. **Unrestricted access** - Runs on 0.0.0.0 without protection

### Solutions Implemented
1. **HTTP Basic Authentication** - All routes now require username/password
2. **Debug mode control** - Only enabled when explicitly set via environment variable
3. **Configurable credentials** - Username/password set via environment variables

### Configuration
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
WEB_DEBUG=False                    # Only set to True for development
WEB_USERNAME=admin                 # Change to your preferred username
WEB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password  # Use a strong password
```

### Default Credentials
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `solar123` (‚ö†Ô∏è **Change this immediately!**)

## üìä Performance Improvements

### Reduced I/O Operations
- **Before**: 720 full file rewrites per hour (~50MB+ written per hour for typical data)
- **After**: 720 single line appends per hour (~70KB written per hour)
- **Improvement**: ~99% reduction in SD card writes

### Memory Efficiency
- Append-only logging reduces memory usage during file operations
- No need to load entire file into memory for each write operation

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

The system maintains full backward compatibility:
- Existing JSON files continue to work
- Web interface reads both JSON and JSONL formats
- Migration is optional but recommended

## üöÄ Additional Benefits

### Reliability
- Reduced risk of data corruption during power failures
- Faster file operations reduce system load
- Better performance on Raspberry Pi Zero's limited resources

### Monitoring
- Added security logging for authentication attempts
- Better error handling for file operations
- Clearer startup messages about security status

## üìã Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Change default password in `.env` file
2. **Soon**: Run migration script to convert existing data
3. **Optional**: Consider HTTPS setup for additional security
4. **Future**: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

## üîç Verification

To verify the improvements are working:

1. **Check file format**: New log files should have `.jsonl` extension
2. **Monitor writes**: Use `iotop` to see reduced I/O activity
3. **Test authentication**: Access web interface - should prompt for credentials
4. **Check debug mode**: Startup logs should show debug status

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Change the default password immediately**
- **Test the migration script on a backup first**
- **Monitor system for a few hours after deployment**
- **Keep the original JSON files as backup until verified**

These improvements significantly enhance system reliability and security while maintaining full functionality.
